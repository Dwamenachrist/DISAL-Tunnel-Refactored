**Speaker 1:** So like I said earlier on, looks like the... the system is truncating some of the information, right? Go back to... go back to Graduation Approval again. Graduation Approval. Yes. So... [Pause] Exams board... continuation... behind... after stamp... Exams board... Uh huh. Yes. That's it. It's complete now.

**Speaker 1:** So, if you want to know, if you want to know how many students have been approved for graduation finally, then you use what we call the coll... the co... the last one. The last one. It’s down there... uh huh... the last Co... Uh huh. If that Col is empty, it simply means that not approved for graduation yet. But if Col is not empty, then simply means that that student has been approved for graduation in February. So if I want to know how many have empty spaces, that will tell me how many cannot graduate.

**Speaker 1:** Are you okay? So, let me say it well. If you go to... we cannot use the empty spaces unfortunately. But instead, we can use the tot... we can use the non-empty space to tell how many students are graduating. If we want to know those not graduating, then all we will do is, we will go back to the grad table and look for how many students are there minus graduating. Does it make sense?

**Speaker 1:** This is why I told you earlier on that, to be able to understand those not graduating, you have to first download or... do an SQL to load students who are not found on the grad table. So you must learn your SQL very well. If you start from graduation approval table and then you map it onto the grad table itself, it will give you approved. But if you go and map the grad table first before the approval data, that will give you non-approval. Does it make sense?

**Speaker 1:** Does it make sense?

**Speaker 2:** Yes please, it makes sense.

**Speaker 1:** So, for now, what I'll do is, start playing with this one for now. Right? Start playing with it. Start writing SQL for it. And start displaying information. But again, as you can see, you have to map it onto the grad table to tell you the program, to tell you the gender... do you even have gender over there? I think so yeah... it should be there. The gender. Not this one. I mean the grad table itself. So you must go and learn how to connect two tables over here. What you are doing now will only give you the dataset you are loading to your application. Then you go to the SQL and go and write your query there and consume it. So learn how to do the SQL... and then come and set it up over here. For now what you have is dataset, which only loads the data from my system into yours. It ends there. Are you okay?

**Speaker 1:** Is that okay now?

**Speaker 2:** [Muffled] Yes please.

**Speaker 1:** If you are speaking you are muted.

**Speaker 2:** Yes please.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So the two major tables you need is the approval table and then the grad table. That's what you need for now. So go and join... go and j... start from approval and then join it onto the grad table. And again you can't do it here, you have to do it under SQL, not under dataset. Dataset only gives you data in that table. But the SQL gives the connection between two tables or more.

**Speaker 2:** Hello Prof. You said I should start from approval and join it to...

**Speaker 1:** Approval. And then join it to...

**Speaker 2:** ...grad table.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly. Is that clear now?

**Speaker 2:** Yes please.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. I think you are now struggling for internet now. So I have to go for a next meeting. So these are the two tables you need. So go and spend time and then learn how to connect it. I could just write it for you in less than 2 minutes but learn it for yourself and then go and create the connection. Okay. Anyway. Yeah so Christie and Shira you are welcome.

**Speaker 3:** Thank you.

**Speaker 1:** Okay good. So now you are now you want to learn because school is about to resume. It's quite unfortunate. Mmm? Anyway. This IT industry, if you don't play it well, it will go against you. Yeah Juman.

**Speaker 2:** Er...

**Speaker 1:** Uh huh. I'm saying...

**Speaker 2:** Yes. So the... your last... You said I should join... I should start from the approval and join it to the grad table.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes please. My network went off.

**Speaker 1:** That's so. That's so.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker 1:** You are welcome. If you do it the other way round, you get people who are not graduating.

**Speaker 2:** Yes yes yes please I get it.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So do it that way and start analyzing it. But it can only be done under SQL, you cannot do it under dataset. It's not possible.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** You should be under SQL. Where you can connect more than one table. Then that becomes... that becomes your dataset at that level. Then you now come and build your various charts. How many males, how many females, and so on and so forth. Based on programs. Group by and all those stuff. You can now do them over there.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Anyway. Yeah so see you then.

**Speaker 2:** Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. Yeah. Like I was saying earlier on, this IT space, if you don't plan your career very well, then by 40th years you are still doing hard things... Which shouldn't be the case. Instead of training people, you are still doing hard things to survive. So you need to understand life in a different way. As an IT person. Or computer science person. It is very critical. Uh huh. It is very critical. If the time that were moving around was used for something else beneficial, that is fine. Yeah that is fine. But you should just let me know that, "Oh we don't have time now." Like it's not by force technically. Mmm? It's not by force. So, if you are handicap, yeah, what's the big deal? We all have personal preference to get things done.

**Speaker 1:** Anyway. The unfortunate thing is whatever assignment I've given to you, I've already done it on the service because I needed it to get the student working. Because the intention was for you guys to use to learn. And the things I give to students to do, they aren't things I cannot do oh. I just don't have time. And two, it's an opportunity to learn. That is the whole idea.

**Speaker 1:** So when people are working for me, they don't work for me, they work for themselves. So once you start thinking about "Oh, I am doing for Professor Patey", it's not for me. It's an opportunity to also learn, used for you to learn. So I just put them down. Like what's the TA? I told the TA to do right now... those who joined earlier, what I'm telling her. There are things I can just spend less than a week to do. But what's the essence when students are around you and they know nothing? That doesn't make sense. That student will be around me and the things I know, they don't know it. Then I'm being wicked to them. Honestly. That's the way I see life.

**Speaker 1:** I don't believe in hoarding or keeping things to myself. No I don't believe in those things. Because if I will be rich I will be rich. I don't need to be rich. If I will be poor I will be poor. I don't need to be poor. It is purely divine. God knows where I will be. So I give things out freely and go my way. That's why I don't keep things in my heart. If it's yes it's yes, if it's no it's no. I say it and go. It ends there. So it is sad to have students around me and not knowing what I can do. Because I don't only teach. Teaching is just a hobby for me. There are several things I do out there but I just don't talk about them. I just keep quiet and just move around.

**Speaker 1:** And guess what, the same students are the ones complaining to my colleagues "Oh I have several things, I don't expose students to things, I always hide it". This same student are the ones saying it. Because they don't see me talking. All they will see is I'll come to class, after class I get vanished. Till the following week again. Once I come to school, once you see me in class, that's the end. You won't see me again till next week. You see? Uh huh. So yes we are not extremely rich but we are okay. We are not competing with anybody.

**Speaker 1:** And did you guys join the internship open day?

**Speaker 3:** No.

**Speaker 1:** Do you even have an idea about what it is?

**Speaker 3:** No.

**Speaker 1:** Ah. But how come? You are on the DISA page?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah I'm on that page but looks like I missed it because I have like different... accounts... I would have to pin that page.

**Speaker 1:** Different account as in?

**Speaker 3:** As in like different groups. Sorry. Different groups.

**Speaker 1:** Oh okay.

**Speaker 3:** So I have to pin it there.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah that's important. Because where your knowledge is should not be kept anyhow. Where you derive your information from should not be kept anyhow. It should be prioritized so you don't miss any information. Because everything we do we share it over there. We don't hide anything anywhere. It's always there. If you had joined you would have seen the kind of things this second years did.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So imagine they are saying "Sir I want a place to host the application and test it". How can they host it? This is where you will come in. So they will come to your application, then we will create an account over there, and say "Oh, just go here, take this SSH account, move here, push your things at this level, and then go and check online." We are done. Just like that. We are done.

**Speaker 1:** So, if I end up creating for example, a new account for someone, how will I be able to expose it? These are things that we want to be hearing from you consistently. You go and try something, you get stuck, you come back. "Oh I couldn't do this." They will meet, we discuss. Then we continue from there. Do you have this guy... Josephus in your class? Do you know him? Josephus?

**Speaker 3:** You mean Josephus Bawa?

**Speaker 1:** Oh okay.

**Speaker 3:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** Oh okay. Then that's fine. Because they are also doing their own project as well. And they've gone extremely far. Almost every two weeks they have something to talk about. Almost every two weeks. They will come. They will get stuck. We share ideas. Then they continue again. And because we all have personal things doing, when they don't come everyday, I'm not worried. All we know is that whenever they come, they have some content to present. You will get stuck, we fix it, and continue from there.

**Speaker 1:** So, the assignment that you are going to be doing now is to go and use Figma... mmm? To design, to do a prototype of how the app should look like based on what I've said today. Go and use Figma to design what I've said today. How you intend to do the app. How it should look like. Go and spend time and then design it. When you are done, come back and let's discuss that interface. If I'm convinced, then the next tasks will continue. How to write the various functions. They will now continue in that way. How to connect to the main servers then. And there are live servers. How to connect to them. In that manner. Gradually. Hoping that before the end of the year about to come, 2026, you'll be able to get something concrete done for yourselves. Are we okay now?

**Speaker 3:** Yes please.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So there is no timeline. As and when you think you are done, just share on the platform for an appointment. We will meet and then we take it from there. In that way.

**Speaker 3:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** So if you can finish tomorrow, I'm available. I'll look at it. If you can finish next week, why not. Next two weeks, why not. But be very comprehensive in the thought process.

**Speaker 3:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. So web app first. When there's time we do mobile app. But web app first. Then we'll continue from there.

**Speaker 3:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Yeah. So I'll be on standby.

**Speaker 3:** Yes please.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Yeah. Goodbye to everyone.

**Speaker 3:** Goodbye.



Here is the **Ultimate Figma Plan** that you can start drawing **right now**.

#### 1. The Persona

- **Primary User:** The Student (Self-serve).
    
- **Secondary User:** The Admin (Read-only view for the Prof to see who is online).
    

#### 2. The Sitemap (Simplified)

You only need to design these 4 "Frames" in Figma.

**A. The "Sales" Page (Public)**

- **Hero Section:** "Instant Hosting for UG Student Projects."
    
- **How it Works:** 3 Icons (Create Account -> Get Command -> Go Live).
    
- **Login Button:** "Student Login."
    

**B. The Dashboard (The "Vending Machine")**

- **State 1: Empty:** "You have no active tunnels." -> Button: [ Create New Project ]
    
- **State 2: Active Card:** This is the most important component. It must show:
    
    - **Project Name:** `MyGradeApp`
        
    - **Status:** 🟢 Online
        
    - **Live URL:** `https://mygradeapp.moyobus.com` (Clickable)
        
    - **The "Secret" Button:** [ View Configuration ]
        

**C. The Configuration Modal (The "Education" Part)**

- This opens when they click "View Configuration" or just after creating a project.
    
- **Tab 1 (SSH):**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 student@moyobus.com
    ```
    
    _(Button: Copy)_
    
- **Tab 2 (FRP):**
    
    Ini, TOML
    
    ```
    [common]
    server_addr = moyobus.com
    ...
    ```
    
- **The "Teaching" Moment:** A small note below the code: _"Run this command in your terminal where your project is running."_ (Simple, not a textbook).
    

**D. The Admin View (The "Bonus")**

- **Purpose:** Just to show the Professor you thought about him.
    
- **Content:** A simple list of "Active Tunnels."
    
    - _Row:_ Student Name | Project Name | Port Assigned | Status | [ Kill Connection ]
        
- **Why this wins:** It shows you thought about _managing_ the server without making him _approve_ every request.
    

---

### Why this approach wins

1. **It listens to the Professor:** It creates the "account" and "exposes it" automatically.
    
2. **It creates a "System":** It handles the port assignment logic visually.
    
3. **It is Comprehensive:** It handles the Student flow AND the Admin oversight flow.
