Yes, you’re done. The push worked, and the design system is on GitHub.

## What’s next

Next step is **learning React by building components**:

1. **Layout shell** — `Sidebar`, `PageHeader`, `MainLayout` (the sidebar + main content pattern)
2. **UI primitives** — `Button`, `Badge` (status dots), `Card`, `Input`
3. **Routing** — React Router with student routes (Landing → Login → Dashboard → Logs)

You’ll learn: props, composition, reuse, and how to match your HTML prototypes.

## Advice for your final year project

### 1. Focus on understanding, not just building

When you use AI or tools, take time to read and change the code. For each component, be able to explain:
- Why it’s structured that way
- How props flow
- How it fits into the overall app

### 2. Build in small, testable steps

Work in small chunks (one component, one screen). Run the app often and check what changes.

### 3. Keep the repo clean and documented

- Use clear, consistent commits like: `feat: add StudentSidebar component`
- Add a short README
- Keep project structure clear so you can explain it in the defense

### 4. Coordinate with your partner

You own the student flow; they own the admin flow. Agree on:
- Shared layout and component APIs
- File structure
- Naming conventions
- How to share and reuse components (e.g. `Button`, `Card`)

### 5. Prepare a clear defense story

Be ready to walk through:

- Problem → Solution  
- Architecture (roles, flows)  
- Design decisions (e.g. why this layout)  
- Challenges and how you solved them  
- What you would improve with more time  

### 6. Avoid over-scoping

Start with the core flows (e.g. student: deploy, view projects, logs). Add extra features only after the basics work.

You’re in good shape with a solid design system. Next focus is the layout shell and first reusable components for the student dashboard.
